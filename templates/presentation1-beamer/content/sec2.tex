  1950s: & Turing, von Neuman: Hand proofs of program
  correctness
  \note{mathematical proofs, not much formal}
\\
  1966/67: & Floyd introduces assertional reasoning on
  flowcharts for proving partial and total correctness.
\\
  1969: & Hoare introduces axiomatic semantics for
  programming constructs.
  \note{basically equivalent to Floyd's thing, but based on a
    programming language and not a flowchart language}
  \\
  & King writes a dissertation on automatic program proving
  through verification condition generation.
  \note{
    based on Floyd's theory and with a theorem prover
    theorems were implications between formulas in disjunctive normal
    form; proof by contradiction - split into smaller formulas and
    check 'false' with a linear solver based on [Kuhn 56] method
  }
\\
  1970s: & Predicate transformer semantics, LCF/ML,
  Boyer-Moore prover, abstract interpretation,
  temporal logic, combination decision procedures.
\\
  1980s: & Model checking, hardware verification, HOL/Coq/Isabelle,
  UNITY, TLA, I/O automata, Z specification language, OBJ3, KIDS.
\\
  1990s: & Symbolic model checking, timed/hybrid model checking,
  predicate abstraction, bounded model checking, B Method, proof
  carrying code, typed assembly language.

Before we finish, and breaking the line of thought of this talk (if
there was one)...
