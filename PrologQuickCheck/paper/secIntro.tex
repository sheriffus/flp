% the Introduction intro, a bit of 'what'
Maintenance is the biggest slice of the development cycle of software
systems.

%
Early detection and correction of bugs is then crucial to minimise
maintenance efforts and therefore associated costs.
%
To detect or prevent such shortcomings testing has been widely used with
growing importance in industry.

%
Regardless of the formal and constructive nature of logic programming,
rare cases and typing mistakes makes it necessary to regularly test
during logic program development.

%  What (is the subject)
Testing a software component or components consists of executing it for
a pre-selected set of inputs (test suite) and inspect if the outputs
respect the expected results.
%
%% Software testing can be classified by the granularity of test focus, the
%% tester point of view or approach.
%% %
%% Tests can focus on the behaviour of single components (unit testing), the
%% correct interaction of components (integration testing) or that the
%% whole system complies to its specification (system testing).
%% %
%% A library user has its access limited to the given interface in order to
%% test its behaviour whereas the developer may want to check invariants
%% and the integrity of internal data-structures.
%
The way individual test cases are chosen to be part of the test suite
can be either manual, where the test developer designs test cases one by
one, or with any degree of automation, resorting to tools for the
effect.
%
Such tools reduce time needed for testing software components and make
it easier to test developing programs.
%
In this paper we will describe \plqc{} (\Prolog\QuickCheck), a \Prolog{}
version of the property based testing framework \QuickCheck, a tool for
testing \Prolog{} programs equipped with predicate specification
test generation.
\todo{cite quickcheck}


%  why  (are we exploring it) and 
Programming in logic languages such as \Prolog{} benefits from automatic
testing due to its untyped nature and backtracking execution model.
%
Its ties to logic reduces the gap between the program and the
specification of properties to be tested.
%
Therefore, a property based approach to testing is intuitive for the
logic programmer.  


%  how  (are we doing it)
Tests are automatically run from formal specifications of general
properties and feedback is given to the tool user about their
evaluation.
%
Properties are stated through a domain-specific language wrapping a
\Prolog{} goal, which \plqc{} checks for a number of inputs.
%
Singleton properties are, even though nor enforced, pure predicate calls
whose successful execution determines that the property holds for the
given input.


The automatic generation of input for a particular test case of a
property is random w.r.t. a maximum size for the generated value.
%
The user has the freedom to decide how to compose the test data
generators to best fit the tests' purpose.
%
From simple generators and using the provided predicate generator
combinators it is possible to obtain generators for more complex
domains, provide suitable value distributions for specific predicates or
predicate uses and to ensure the relation between the arguments applied
to the predicates being tested is valid.


Following the original \QuickCheck{} implementation, our main tool is
lightweight and completely integrated in \Prolog{}.
%
On top of this lightweight testing tool we have built predicate
specification testing.
%
By specifying some aspects of a predicate in a proper specification
language it is possible to generate a \plqc{} property and check it.
%
We have used \plqc{} and its predicate specification in a number of
predicates and even libraries.
