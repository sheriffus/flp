This paper presents an automatic tool for property-based testing of
properties in the logic programming language \Prolog{}.
%
The tool is based on the well known QuickCheck for the functional
programming language Haskell, but addresses new features to deal with
specific characteristics of Prolog such as the absence of a strong type
discipline and being a relational language (in opposite to Haskell).


In this tool properties are described as \Prolog{} goals.
%
We also enable the definition of custom test data generators using a
predicate specification language that includes types, modes and
constraints on the number of successful computations.

Finally we present a number of  examples in which the tool is
successfully used and a large case study on Prolog libraries for AVL
search trees.
