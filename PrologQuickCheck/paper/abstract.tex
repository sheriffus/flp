We present a tool for property-based testing of properties in the logic
programming language \Prolog{}.
%
Properties are described within \Prolog{} and automatically testable.

In our tool, logic properties are goals in the logic programming
language or properties composed with proper connectives.
%
The truth values of particular instances of that property are respectful
to the executions of the goal or the adequate combination of the results
of the connected properties.


We show some examples of properties of logic programs tested
using \plqc{} as well as a case study on available libraries for search
trees.
