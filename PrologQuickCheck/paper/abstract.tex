We present a tool for property-based testing of logic properties
in the logic programming language \Prolog{}.
%
We show several examples of its usage and a case study to help assess
its usefulness and usability.


In our tool, logic properties are goals in the logic programming language.
%
The truth values of particular instances of that property are successful
executions of the goal.


We show some examples of properties of logic programs tested
using \plqc{} as well as a case study on available libraries for search
trees.
