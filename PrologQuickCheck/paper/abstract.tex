We present \plqc{}, an automatic tool for property-based
testing of properties of the logic programming language \Prolog{} with
randomised test data generation.
%
The tool is inspired by the well known \QuickCheck, originally designed
for the functional programming language \Haskell{}. It includes features
that deal with specific characteristics of \Prolog{} such as its
relational nature (as opposed to \Haskell{}) and the absence of a strong
type discipline.


\plqc{} expressiveness stems from describing properties as
\Prolog{} goals.
%
It enables the definition of custom test data generators for
random testing tailored for the property to be tested.
%
Further, it allows the use of a predicate specification language that
supports types, modes and constraints on the number of successful
computations.
%
We evaluate our tool on a number of  examples and apply
it successfully to debug a \Prolog{} library for AVL search trees.
