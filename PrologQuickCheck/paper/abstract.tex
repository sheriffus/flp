We present \Prolog\QuickCheck{}, an automatic tool for property-based
testing of properties of the logic programming language \Prolog{}.
%
The tool is based on the well known QuickCheck, originally designed
for the functional programming language \Haskell{}, but includes new
features that deal with specific characteristics of Prolog such as the
its relational nature (in opposition to \Haskell{}) and the absence
of a strong type discipline.


\Prolog\QuickCheck{} expressiveness stems from describing properties as
\Prolog{} goals.
%
Further, it allows the use of a predicate specification language that
supports types, modes and constraints on the number of successful
computations.
%
It also enables the definition of custom test data generators for
random testing.
%
We evaluate our tool on a number of  examples and apply
it successfully to debugging a \Prolog{} library for AVL search trees.
